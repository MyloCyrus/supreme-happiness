Problem Description: 

1)
       A program was shown to take advantage of telnet in a manner that 
       allowed passwords and login strings to be snooped when a user logged
       in using telnet.

2)     When a user telnets into another host and starts running a command that
       outputs to the terminal in the background; then terminates the telnet session,
       then starts a new telnet session to the same system the new telnet session
       will get output from the previous session.

INSTALL: 

  # mv /usr/etc/in.telnetd /usr/etc/in.telnetd.FCS
  # chmod 600 /usr/etc/in.telnetd.FCS (as a precaution, after verifying the new version,
                                       the old version should be removed)
  # cp sun{3,3x,4,4c}/in.telnetd /usr/etc/in.telnetd
  # chmod 755 /usr/etc/in.telnetd
  # chown root /usr/etc/in.telnetd
  # chgrp staff /usr/etc/in.telnetd

 kill any existing in.telnetd that is running.
